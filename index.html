      <h1>How to Learn Programming?</h1>
      <p>
        Programming is lots of fun and extraordinarily useful. It allows you to be creative while opening up a wide range of new career opportunities. 
        You'll need to choose a coding language to study
         before taking advantage of all the available online resources. 
         Learning how to code is like learning a language; you'll need to be consistent,
          disciplined, and open-minded! Many free online classes are available to learn to
           code from!

      <h2>The Odin Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning"
        resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or
        the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is
        right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap
        for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high
        quality education.

      <h2>This is CS50</h2>
      <p>
        This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual
        enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors
        and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An
        entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how
        to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. The on-campus
        version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.
